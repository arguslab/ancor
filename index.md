### Overview
Moving Target Defenses (MTD) have been proposed as a game changing approach to cyber security that eliminates the static nature of current computer systems -- an attacker’s biggest advantage. The core idea of MTD is to make a system change proactively as a means to eliminating the asymmetric advantage the attacker has on time. 

**M**oving **T**arget **D**efense for **C**loud-**B**ased **IT S**ystems (**MTD CBITS**) is a platform that 
automatically adapts multiple aspects of the network’s logical and physical configuration. The platform is 
targeting a cloud infrastructure and is built on top of **ANCOR**. 
ANCOR is a framework for creating and managing cloud-based IT systems using a high-level abstraction (an up-to-date 
IT system inventory). While ANCOR was focused on creating and managing IT systems in a reliable and automated way, 
the MTD CBITS work analyzes the feasibility and potential security benefits of an MTD approach based on live 
instance replacement. Why live instance replacements? A live instance replacement mechanism can be the means to 
deploying various defenses in an automated way while constantly removing attackers’ persistent access.

## What is MTD CBITS?
Moving Target Defense for Cloud-Based IT Systems (MTD CBITS) is a platform that 
automatically adapts multiple aspects of the network’s logical and physical configuration. 
The platform is targeting OpenStack and is built on top of ANCOR. 
ANCOR is a framework that captures the high-level user requirements and translates them into 
a working IT system on a cloud infrastructure.

## General Requirements
- In order to use MTD CBITS and/or ANCOR, the user needs an OpenStack cloud infrastructure that the MTD CBITS/ANCOR VM can reach.

- The MTD CBITS/ANCOR VM should be reachable by the instances running on the OpenStack infrastructure (i.e., MTD CBITS/ANCOR VM should run in bridged mode).

- The necessary Puppet manifests that are needed for the system that will be deployed with MTD CBITS or ANCOR.
